Discuss features of the Enterprise Notes that are candidates to be executed on the client side instead of on the server. Clearly describe the pros and cons.

1.  • All persistent data (notes, user accounts, etc.) are to be stored in a suitable datastore. Explain the design choices you made to interact with the database.
2.  • The enterprise typically hosts a variety of operating systems and internet browsers. Discuss how your solution copes with this variety.
3.  • Provide a "Quick Start Guide" outlining the steps and details required to install your application on a new server.
4.  • Provide a document that lists the additional specifications that were missing but required to implement your solution.
