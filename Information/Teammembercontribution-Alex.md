# Team Member contribution

By Alex Borawski

In this assignment we were tasked to make a sharing note program that would scale well with company size with Go being the main language in use. There was also expected to be unit testing and documentation of setup, data models and design choices.

OVer the course of the assignment, I was primarily involved in creating, testing and bug fixing the main code, whilst Katherine did a lot of work in documentation and front end development.

In the following categories I would say Katherine rates:

**Preparation:** 6/10

**Participation:** 9/10

**Reliability:** 10/10

She was very good at delivering things on time and getting involved, but where she lacked was understanding how things within the code functioned. This could be due to a lackluster communication on my part, but more likely it was due to her struggling to understand how Go code works. Otherwise she was a reliable teammate who would bring good ideas to the table.
