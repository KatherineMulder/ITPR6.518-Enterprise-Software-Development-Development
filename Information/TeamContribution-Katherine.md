**Team Member Contribution**

It was a pleasure working with Alex. We supported each other throughout our journey, sharing both our successes and challenges. In this course, I not only learned about programming but also gained valuable experience in collaborating with teammates. Alex and I have different approaches to working on our projects, each with our own strengths and weaknesses.

It took me some time to fully grasp how programming works, so Alex initially took the lead in coding, while I concentrated on testing the functions he created. However, as I gained a better understanding, I also started contributing by developing some of the functions myself. This collaboration allowed us to leverage each other's strengths and weaknesses effectively, ultimately leading to the successful achievement of our goals.
