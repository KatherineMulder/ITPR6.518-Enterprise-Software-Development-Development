#Progress Report 

**Introduction**
This progress report is a fundamental component of our ongoing assessment. Its role is twofold: to help us identify and address potential programming challenges early in the development process and to maintain a transparent record of our project's growth.
As part of our assessment requirements, we are obligated to provide regular updates at the commencement of each practical session. This practice signifies our commitment to the successful completion of our assignment. Through this report, our aim is to demonstrate our dedication to achieving the success of our project.

**Progress Milestones**
During our project, we worked closely as a team and used effective communication to achieve our goals. In our report, we have five main categories to show how we reached important project milestones:

`Work Completed:` We documented the tasks we finished or improved since our last update.
`Milestones Achieved:` We noted the big achievements we reached, like finishing important parts of the project or meeting deadlines.
`Challenges Faced:` We talked about the tough parts we encountered, whether it was technical issues or academic problems.
`Solutions and Strategies:` We explained how we solved or planned to solve these challenges. This shows how we think and make decisions.
`Adjustments Made:`We shared if we changed our project's plan, design, or how we approached the academic side. We explained why we made these changes.

**The first couple of weeks:**
At the beginning of our project, our main goal was to understand what we needed to do. We looked closely at our assignment to figure out all the details, like what we had to do and what the goals were.

**Learning the Basics of Go Programming:**
During the phase of learning the fundamentals of Go programming, our primary focus was to get a grasp of the basics of the Go programming language. We worked on becoming familiar with the Go programming environment and establishing our workspace for the project.

* Work Completed:
&#x2611;Workspace Setup: We successfully set up our work environment for Go programming. This involved configuring the necessary tools and software to begin coding in Go.
&#x2611;GitHub Repository Creation>We created a GitHub repository for our project. This repository serves as our central platform for collaboration, where we can share and work on our project code collectively.

* Challenges Faced: 
We encountered difficulties in configuring some of the necessary tools and software required to set up our Go programming environment.
<br>
* Solutions and Strategies:
We consulted documentation and tutorials to ensure the correct setup of tools. We also requested assistance from lecture.
